# Contacts Widget - Quick Access to Your Contacts

> Keep your contacts with you even without a mobile phone.
> The contacts widget lets you configure up to 11 contacts with names and phone numbers for instant access. The contacts are stored on the watch/device, making them accessible regardless of your phone. Browse your contacts directly from the widget - no need to navigate to an app on the device.
> Switch quickly and easily between contacts using the start/stop button. On devices with touch functionality a simple tap on the display will show the next contact.
> Contacts can be stored via the widget settings. To do so, open the Garmin Connect IQ app, navigate to the widget and open the settings of the widget.

## Inspiration & Acknowledgements

This widget was inspired by the [CONTACTS](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/eb056a70-fb5a-47b2-946b-0c5aef2b670b) app. I preferred a widget over an app, as widgets are more quickly accessible with fewer device interactions. Special thanks to developer [AmuFac](https://apps.garmin.com/developer/cd9b42d6-042a-416a-bf7e-e6dd8c236a2c/apps) for providing inspiration and a foundation to build upon.
