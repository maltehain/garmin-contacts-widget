# Contacts Widget - Quick Access to Your Contacts

> Keep your contacts with you even without a mobile phone.
> The contacts widget lets you configure up to 11 contacts with names and phone numbers for instant access. The contacts are stored on the watch/device, making them accessible regardless of your phone. Browse your contacts directly from the widget - no need to navigate to an app on the device.
> Switch quickly and easily between contacts using the start/stop button. On devices with touch functionality a simple tap on the display will show the next contact.
> Contacts can be stored via the widget settings. To do so, open the Garmin Connect IQ app, navigate to the widget and open the settings of the widget.
